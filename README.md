Our Project 2 data set lists the general information on all
kickstarter campaigns since its conception in 2009, until the beginning of 2018.
We aim to better understand the world's largest funding platform for creative projects,
so others can make well-informed investments based off our findings and conclusions.

Questions that guided our analysis:
1. What project category (genre/type) gets backed the most?
2. How many backers are there for each campaign in the top 100 funded campaigns?
3. What is the % of success based on the length of the project?
4. What is the % of success based on the funding goal amount?
5. What type of Kickstarter project reaches its funding goal most often? (maybe this one can be a sub question for 1...)
6. What type of Kickstarter project fails to reach its funding goal most often?
7. Finally, what type of project should you invest in?
