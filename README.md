Our Project 2 data set lists the general information on all kickstarter campaigns since its conception in 2009, until the beginning of 2018. We aim to better understand the world's largest funding platform for creative projects, so others can make well-informed investments based off our findings and conclusions.

Questions that guided our analysis:
1. What specific project category receives the most backers?
2. What specific project category receives the most funding?
3. What specific project category fails to reach its funding goal most often?
4. How many backers does each campaign receive among the top 100 funded campaigns?
5. What is the percentage of success based on the length of the project?
6. What is the percentage of success based on the funding goal amount?
7. Finally, what type of project grants investors the highest probability of success?
